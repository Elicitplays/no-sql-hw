This homework wasn't too bad. I understood the concepts of querying in MongoDB and importing the data first. Took a bit of trial and error but otherwise pretty straight forward. In regards to the analysis itself that was also intuitive. Seeing how to aggregate and filtering was also very straightforward. Overall this wasn't too bad. I will say two things.
1. Its annoying to look up which functions were deprecated and which weren't. Made it into a wild goose chase for me.
2. Final thing is some questions regarding the datatypes for the Hygiene scores. In question 3, the data for hygiene scores showed none. Not sure if that's intentional with the data or 'none' literally mean 0. Not sure about that but otherwise good project.
